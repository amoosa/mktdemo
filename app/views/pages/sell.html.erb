<h3>Sell with Us.</h3>

<p>Join us and be part of our growing marketplace. </p>

<p>We work with designers and brands based on the originality of their design and quality of workmanship. As a result of our selection process, your work is more visible on our site and it provides a better shopping experience for our customers. </p>

<p><b>What do we look for? </b></p>

<p>
We look for four things when approving designers and brands to sell with us.</b>
<ul>
	<li>Original design. No knockoffs.</li>
	<li>Clear product images. If you need help with photography, let us know. </li>
	<li>You must be able to ship out an order within 1-2 business days. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>How it works?</b>
<ul>
	<li><font color="green"><b>Apply:</b></font> Tell us about your line at <b>partner[at]outfitadditions.com</b> with a short background on your designs/brand and a url where we can see your line - either a link to your ecommerce store or a link to your items on another marketplace. If you are a designer, please tell us a bit about your background as well.</li>
	<li>You will hear from us within 1-3 business days after you apply.</li>
	<li>Once you're approved, we give you access to our marketplace where you can list your items, manage orders and tell your story. We have a csv import option so you don't have to enter your listings one by one. It's easy and quick to list with us.</li>
	<li>When your product sells, you get an email with the order and customer address. Once you ship, enter the tracking number and confirm your shipment.</li>
	<li>We charge a 20% commission on sales + standard credit card fees. For example, if an item sells for $50, about 3% goes to our secure payment provider <a href="http://www.stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a> for processing fees, 20% to us and the rest is transfered directly to your bank account. 
	<li>We require all sellers to offer free US shipping and 30 day returns. Shipping & returns are important considerations for customers when shopping online and we feel this will increase your sales. Please price your products accordingly.</li>
</ul>
