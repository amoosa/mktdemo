<h3>Apply to Sell on Our Platform!</h3>

<p>Do you make or design Jewelry? Or do you manage a boutique brand? Apply to sell with us and be part of our growing marketplace. We are different from bigger marketplaces like Ebay, Etsy, Amazon in that we work with sellers based on the their design aesthetic and quality of workmanship. We don’t feature tens of thousands of designers. As a result of our selection process, your work is more visible on our site and it provides a better shopping experience for our customers. </p>

<b>What do we look for when approving designs?</b>
<p>
We look for four things when selecting designers.
<ul>
	<li>Original design: We don’t allow sellers to sell other designers merchandise. The designs need to be yours or your company’s.</li>
	<li>Photography: In order to provide a great shopping experience for our customers, we require photography to meet the below criteria.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Must be on a light colored background – it doesn’t have to be white but light gray, beige, and other soft color backgrounds are accepted. We do not allow props. </li>
		<li>The first pic must be a product shot with no props or model. The second to fourth pics are optional. Please use the additional pics to show more detail if necessary. Products worn by a model are encouraged as it gives the customer a better idea of size and/or length of the piece.</li>
		<li>On product-only shots, the product must occupy 60-80% of the image. Images must be of a big enough size to show detail. We resize your images to be smaller to optimize for the web but we obviously cannot enlarge your images so please upload images that show your product details clearly. We accept up to 4 images per item. </li>
		<li>test</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Quality of workmanship: Based on the photographs, we looks for quality workmanship and materials. Products don’t need to be handmade. They can be imported. However, the design must be owned by you or your company.</li>
	<li>Price point: We focus on fashion jewelry. Most designers on our site sell at price points under $100. Higher is ok but our products are very rarely over $200. We do not accept designers selling precious stones, gold or other fine jewelry.</li>
</ul>
