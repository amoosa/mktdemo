<h3>Sell with Us.</h3>

<p>Join us and be part of our growing marketplace. </p>

<p>We work with designers and brands based on the their design aesthetic and quality of workmanship. We donâ€™t feature tens of thousands of designers. As a result of our selection process, your work is more visible on our site and it provides a better shopping experience for our customers. </p>

<p>
We look for three things when selecting designers.
<ul>
	<li>Original design. No knockoffs.</li>
	<li>Clear product images on a light background. White or light gray backgrounds are preferred. </li>
	<li>We welcome designers who handmake their line. But we are not exclusively a handmade marketplace. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>How it works?</b>
<ul>
	<li>You will hear from us within 2-3 business days after you apply to sell with us.</li>
	<li>Once you're approved, we give you access to our marketplace where you can list your items, manage orders and tell your story. We have a csv import option so you don't have to enter your listings one by one. It's easy and quick to list with us.</li>
	<li>When your product sells, you get an email with the order and customer address. Once you ship, enter the tracking number and confirm your shipment.</li>
	<li>We charge a 20% commission on sales. This commission is taken after deducting 2.9%+30 cents for credit card processing (goes to the card processor, Stripe). For example, if an item sells for $50, after 2.9% + 30 cents, the balance is $48.25. 80% of that amount ($36.80) is transfered to your bank account.
	<li>We require all sellers to offer free US shipping and 30 day returns. Shipping & returns are important considerations for customers when shopping online and we feel this will increase your sales. Please price your products accordingly.</li>
</ul>
