<p><strong>STEP 2: </strong>Upload your file on the <%= link_to "listing page", new_listing_path, data: { no_turbolink: true }  %>. Depending on the number of products and the size of your images, it may take a while. Please check your “Manage your listings” page in a few minutes to check status. </p>

<p><strong>TESTING TIP: </strong>
Before uploading a large number of items, test out your file by uploading 2-3 items. If those upload correctly, then upload the full file with the rest of your products.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>FIXING FILE ERRORS:</strong>
When you refresh the page per the above process, yu may see an error message. Please follow the below instructions to figure out what went wrong.

<ul>
    <li>Refresh the page to check if any of your listings loaded.</li>
    <li>If none of your listings loaded, check if your file has the column names that are as specified above and check <li>if you have all the required columns in the file.</li>
    <li>If some of your listings have loaded, then it means that the next listing in the file did not load because of an error in that row. Look carefully at the next listing in your file and check if you meet all the <em>conditions &amp; formats</em> section in the table above in this document.</li>
    <li>After you make changes, you can upload your entire file again. Listings will not be duplicated so you can upload your full file again if you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you still cannot figure out why your file does not load, please send us your file to <u>service@outfitadditions.com</u></p>

<p><strong>UPDATING MULTIPLE PRODUCTS USING IMPORT:</strong></p>

<p>If you wish to update multiple listings, you can make your changes in a csv file in the same format as above, and upload your file. Please do not change the Product ID of your listing. Our system will check if the Product ID exists and if so, it will update your listings with the new information.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to add a SalePrice to 50 products, you can download your existing listings via the Download link in the ‘Manage Listings’ page. Then add a SalePrice to the 50 items and upload the same file back up via the Import listings page. Depending on the number of listings, our system may take a few minutes to make the changes.
</p>
    

<p>You can test your file by uploading a file with 2-3 products. If it uploads without error, it means that your file format is correct. Then try uploading the full file. </p>


<p><em>Note: If you need to change your product ID, then the only way is to delete your original listing and load it again with the new Product ID.</em></p>


<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: IMAGES</strong></p>

<p>When you paste the URL into your browser, you should see <u>only</u> the product image. See examples below.</p>

<p>If you have an ecommerce store or sell on other marketplaces, you can export your product file from your site admin. Your image URL’s should be available in that export. Here are some image URL examples.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you use Shopify, you’d have image url’s like the below:
    <a href="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0068/1062/products/TrixieNecklace1_large.jpg?v=1403105325">
        <em>http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0068/1062/products/TrixieNecklace1_large.jpg?v=1403105325</em>
    </a>
   </li>
    <li>
        If you use Big Commerce, you’d have url’s like:
        <a href="http://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server1200/f8ce1/products/1064/images/1989/historic-necklace-2__99263.1405343108.400.400.jpg?c=2">
            <em>http://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server1200/f8ce1/products/1064/images/1989/historic-necklace-2__99263.1405343108.400.400.jpg?c=2</em>
        </a>
        <em></em>
    </li>
    <li>
        If you sell on Etsy, you’d have url’s like:
        <a href="https://img0.etsystatic.com/014/0/6558506/il_570xN.456405658_dn47.jpg">
            <em>https://img0.etsystatic.com/014/0/6558506/il_570xN.456405658_dn47.jpg</em>
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t have an ecommerce store where your images are hosted, you can open a free dropbox.com account and save your images there. Dropbox stores your files on the cloud and gives you a url for each image. Here is a quick overview on how you can get image url’s from dropbox. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Open a free dropbox account at dropbox.com.</li>
    <li>After installing, open the dropbox folder on your desktop. Copy your image files into your dropbox folder.</li>
    <li>Right click on an image file and click on the “Share Dropbox Link” option. This will copy a link that you can paste into the CSV alongside your product. Do this for each product.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>OPTIONAL: Using HTML in your product descriptions:</strong></p>

<p>In your description field, we accept select html tags to help you format your descriptions. We accept the following html tags in the description field so you can format your descriptions: &lt;b&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;. If you haven’t used html before, here is a quick overview of these tags.</p>

<p>Bold tag: Any text between &lt;b&gt;….&lt;/b&gt; will be bolded. For example, &lt;b&gt;Measurements:&lt;/b&gt; will show up as <strong>Measurements:</strong></p>

<p>Paragraph tag: Any text between &lt;p&gt;….&lt;/p&gt; will be in a separate paragraph. This will automatically insert a blank line above and below your text to make it a new paragraph.</p>

<p>Bulleted lists: Here is an example. If you enter the below in the 'description' column in the csv file….</p>

<p>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt; this is the first bullet &lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt; this is the second bullet &lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt; this is the third bullet &lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt; this is the fourth bullet &lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;
</p>

<p>Your output on the site will look like this…
<ul>
    <li>
        this is the first bullet
    </li>
    <li>
        this is the second bullet
    </li>
    <li>
        this is the third bullet
    </li>
    <li>
        this is the fourth bullet
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
